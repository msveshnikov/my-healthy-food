## Sprint Plan - Sprint 1 (Feb 27 2025 - Mar 12 2025)

**Sprint Goal:** Establish a functional core recipe generation and rendering flow with basic user
authentication and administrative capabilities, ensuring a stable foundation for future feature
development.

**Sprint Dates:** Feb 27 2025 - Mar 12 2025 (2 weeks)

**Selected User Stories/Tasks:**

| **Priority** | **Type** | **User Story/Task** | **Estimated Effort (Story Points)** |
**Dependencies/Risks** **1. [P] High** | **[Bug] Fix Recipe schema + model + rendering:** _
**Effort:** 8 Story Points _ **Description:** Investigate and resolve the issues causing incorrect
recipe data structure, backend model discrepancies, and rendering problems on the frontend. This
includes: _ Reviewing `recipeSchema.json` for accuracy and completeness. _ Ensuring
`models/Recipe.js` correctly implements the schema and data validation. _ Debugging `Recipe.jsx` to
accurately display recipe data according to the schema. _ Writing unit tests for backend model and
frontend rendering components. _ **Dependencies:** Backend team needs to finalize the recipe schema
and model. Frontend team depends on backend to provide a stable API for recipe data. _ **Risk:**
This is a critical path item. Delay in fixing this will block recipe display and user experience.

**2. [P] High** | **[Feature] User Authentication (Login, Signup, Forgot Password):** _ **Effort:**
5 Story Points _ **Description:** Implement user authentication features including: _ Develop Login
and Signup forms (`Login.jsx`, `SignUp.jsx`) with input validation. _ Implement "Forgot Password"
and "Reset Password" functionality (`Forgot.jsx`, `Reset.jsx`). _ Securely handle user credentials
and session management using `middleware/auth.js` and `user.js` in the server. _ Implement basic UI
feedback for authentication status. _ **Dependencies:** Backend team needs to implement user
authentication API endpoints in `user.js` and authentication middleware in `middleware/auth.js`. _
**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in authentication can compromise user data. Proper security
practices must be followed.

**3. [P] High** | **[Improvement] Responsive Design for Recipe Rendering:** _ **Effort:** 3 Story
Points _ **Description:** Enhance the responsiveness of the recipe rendering to ensure optimal
viewing on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). _ Implement responsive CSS for `Recipe.jsx`
component. _ Test responsiveness on different screen sizes and browsers. _ **Dependencies:**
Requires a working `Recipe.jsx` component from task 1. _ **Risk:** Poor responsiveness can lead to
negative user experience, especially on mobile.

**4. [P] Medium** | **[Feature] Basic Admin Panel (User & Feedback Management):** _ **Effort:** 5
Story Points _ **Description:** Develop a basic admin panel (`Admin.jsx`) to: _ Display a list of
users with basic information. _ Display user feedback submitted through `Feedback.jsx`. _ Implement
basic moderation actions (e.g., view user details, delete feedback - basic scope for Sprint 1). _
Secure admin panel access using authentication. _ **Dependencies:** Backend team needs to provide
API endpoints for fetching users and feedback data in `admin.js`. _ **Risk:** Admin panel needs to
be secure to prevent unauthorized access and data manipulation.

**5. [P] Medium** | **[Improvement] Implement CI/CD Pipeline (Basic):** _ **Effort:** 3 Story Points
_ **Description:** Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process. _
Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions). _ Configure pipeline to build and deploy client and
server applications to a staging environment upon code commit to a designated branch (e.g.,
`develop`). _ Basic automated tests integration in the pipeline. _ **Dependencies:** Requires access
to hosting/deployment environment. \* **Risk:** Initial CI/CD setup can be time-consuming and may
require DevOps expertise.

**6. [P] Medium** | **[Feature] Basic Social Sharing Integration:** _ **Effort:** 2 Story Points _
**Description:** Implement basic social sharing functionality for recipes. _ Add social sharing
buttons to `Recipe.jsx` (e.g., for Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest). _ Basic sharing functionality -
sharing recipe link and title. _ **Dependencies:** Requires a working `Recipe.jsx` component from
task 1. _ **Risk:** Social sharing integration might be less prioritized if core features are
delayed.

**7. [P] Medium** | **[Feature] Basic Image Integration (Unsplash/Google Images):** _ **Effort:** 2
Story Points _ **Description:** Implement basic image integration for recipes. _ Integrate with
Unsplash or Google Images API in `imageService.js` on the server. _ Display fetched images in
`Recipe.jsx`. _ Start with basic image fetching based on recipe keywords. _ **Dependencies:**
Backend needs to implement image service in `imageService.js`. Frontend needs a working `Recipe.jsx`
component. \* **Risk:** Image integration might be less prioritized if core features are delayed.

**Total Estimated Effort:** 28 Story Points

**Definition of Done for Sprint 1:**

- All selected user stories/tasks are completed as described above and meet acceptance criteria.
- "Fix Recipe schema + model + rendering" task is resolved, and recipes are displayed correctly and
  responsively.
- User authentication (login, signup, forgot password) is functional and secure.
- Basic admin panel is accessible and allows viewing users and feedback.
- Basic CI/CD pipeline is set up to deploy to a staging environment.
- Code is reviewed, merged, and committed to the main branch.
- Unit and/or integration tests are implemented for core functionalities and are passing.
- No critical bugs or blockers remain open at the end of the sprint.
- Sprint Goal: "Establish a functional core recipe generation and rendering flow with basic user
  authentication and administrative capabilities, ensuring a stable foundation for future feature
  development" is achieved.

**Contingency Plan:**

- If "Fix Recipe schema + model + rendering" task takes longer than expected, we will reduce the
  scope of lower priority tasks like Social Sharing and Image Integration to ensure the sprint goal
  is still achievable.
- Regular daily stand-ups to track progress and identify blockers early.
- Dedicated time for bug fixing and issue resolution during the sprint.
