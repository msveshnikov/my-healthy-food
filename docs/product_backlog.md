### **High Priority - Must Have for Core Functionality & Stability**

| [P] | [Type] | User Story/Item | Notes **[P] High** | **[Bug] Fix Recipe schema + model +
rendering:** Resolve issues with the recipe data structure (schema), backend model (`Recipe.js`),
and frontend rendering (`Recipe.jsx`) to ensure recipes are displayed correctly and consistently.
Based on the TODO in the README, this is a critical issue. | **[P] High** | **[Feature] User
Authentication (Login, Signup, Forgot Password):** Ensure complete and secure user authentication
functionality is implemented, including login, signup, and password recovery. Essential for user
data protection and personalized experience. | **[P] High** | **[Improvement] Responsive Design for
Recipe Rendering:** Improve the responsiveness of recipe rendering, especially on mobile devices,
ensuring readability and usability across different screen sizes. | **[P] Medium** | **[Feature]
Social Sharing Integration:** Implement social sharing functionality to allow users to easily share
generated recipes on social media platforms. | **[P] Medium** | **[Feature] Image Integration
(Unsplash/Google Images):** Ensure seamless integration with Unsplash and Google Images to fetch and
display relevant and appealing images for recipes. | **[P] Medium** | **[Improvement] SEO
Optimization for Recipe Pages:** Implement SEO best practices for recipe pages to improve
discoverability in search engines. Focus on schema markup, relevant keywords, and URL structure. |
**[P] Medium** | **[Feature] Basic Admin Panel (User & Feedback Management):** Develop a basic admin
panel (`Admin.jsx`) to allow administrators to view user feedback, and manage users (view,
potentially basic moderation actions). | **[P] Medium** | **[Improvement] Implement CI/CD
Pipeline:** Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process, improving
development workflow and release reliability. | **[P] Low** | **[Improvement] Enhance In-App
Documentation (Docs.jsx):** Populate the `Docs.jsx` component with helpful user guides and
contextual help to improve user onboarding and feature understanding. | **[P] Low** |
**[Improvement] Implement User Feedback System:** Fully implement the `Feedback.jsx` component to
allow users to easily provide feedback on the platform and recipes. | **[P] Low** | **[Tech Debt]
Review and Refactor Backend AI Integrations:** Review the AI integration files (`claude.js`,
`deepseek.js`, etc.) for code quality, error handling, and potential refactoring for better
maintainability. | **[P] Low** | **[Improvement] Detailed Logging and Alerting (Backend):**
Implement more detailed logging in the backend to monitor system health and user activity. Basic
alerting for critical errors should also be considered. | **[P] Low** | **[Improvement]
Component-Driven UI Design:** Begin refactoring existing UI components to be more reusable and
consistent, laying the groundwork for future feature development.

### **Removed or Completed Items:**

- **No items explicitly removed or completed** based on the provided information. However, "fix
  Recipe schema + model + rendering" is being tracked as a High Priority item, indicating it is not
  yet completed, despite being listed as a TODO previously.

### **Additional Notes & Comments:**

- **Focus on Core Functionality First:** The immediate priority should be on stabilizing the core
  recipe generation and rendering functionality, as highlighted by the existing TODO. User
  authentication and basic admin features are also critical for a functional platform.
- **Iterative Development:** Adopt an iterative development approach. Focus on delivering a Minimum
  Viable Product (MVP) with core features working reliably before adding more complex features.
- **User Feedback is Crucial:** Actively solicit and analyze user feedback once the platform is
  usable, even in a basic form. This feedback will be invaluable for prioritizing future features
  and improvements.
- **Scalability Considerations:** While scalability is mentioned in the design ideas, it's likely
  not a High priority at this early stage unless there's an anticipated surge in users. Focus on
  building a solid foundation first, then address scalability as needed.
- **Technology Stack:** The project already has a defined tech stack (React, Node.js, potentially
  MongoDB). Ensure the team is proficient with these technologies.
- **Testing:** While not explicitly listed, ensure that unit and integration testing are
  incorporated into the development process, especially for core features like recipe generation and
  user authentication.

This updated product backlog provides a clearer roadmap for the "My Healthy Food" project,
prioritizing essential features and improvements to build a solid and valuable platform. Remember to
continuously review and adjust the backlog as the project progresses and new information becomes
available.
