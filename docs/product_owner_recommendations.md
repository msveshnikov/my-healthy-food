## Product Backlog Prioritization - Sprint 1

Here's a prioritized list of features for the next sprint, starting on Thu Feb 27 2025, for the "My
Healthy Food" project, based on the provided information and project structure.

**1. Fix Recipe Schema, Model, and Rendering**

- **Priority:** High - Critical Path
- **Explanation:** This is explicitly mentioned in the `TODO` and is foundational for the entire
  application. Without a properly defined recipe schema, a working data model, and a functional
  rendering component, the core feature of generating and displaying recipes will be broken. This
  must be addressed first to enable any further development and testing of other features.

**2. Basic AI-Powered Recipe Generation (MVP)**

- **Priority:** High - Core Functionality
- **Explanation:** The core value proposition of "My Healthy Food" is AI-powered recipe generation.
  This sprint should aim to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of this feature. This
  would involve:
    - Selecting **one AI engine** to begin with (e.g., OpenAI) for initial implementation to reduce
      complexity.
    - Implementing the basic logic to send a user prompt (via JSON) to the chosen AI engine.
    - Receiving and processing the AI-generated recipe in a basic format.
    - This will allow for end-to-end testing of the core AI functionality and provide a foundation
      to build upon.

**3. Basic Rich Recipe Rendering (MVP)**

- **Priority:** Medium - User Experience
- **Explanation:** Once recipes are being generated, they need to be displayed to the user in a
  readable and somewhat appealing format. This sprint should focus on creating a basic "rich recipe
  rendering" component (`Recipe.jsx`) that can display the key elements of a recipe (title,
  ingredients, instructions) in a structured and visually acceptable way. This doesn't need to be
  fully polished at this stage, but functional and understandable.

**4. Database Setup and Integration for Recipes (MVP)**

- **Priority:** Medium - Data Persistence & Foundation
- **Explanation:** To persist and manage recipes, a database needs to be set up and integrated. This
  sprint should focus on:
    - Finalizing the `recipeSchema.json` based on the "fix Recipe schema" task.
    - Implementing the `models/Recipe.js` to interact with the database.
    - Setting up basic database connectivity in the server (`index.js`).
    - Implementing basic API endpoints in the server (`index.js` or a dedicated recipe controller
      file) to store and retrieve recipe data.
    - This provides the necessary backend infrastructure for recipe management and future features
      like saving and sharing recipes.

**5. Basic User Authentication - Signup and Login (MVP)**

- **Priority:** Low - User Management Foundation
- **Explanation:** While not immediately critical for core recipe generation, basic user
  authentication (Signup and Login functionalities via `SignUp.jsx` and `Login.jsx` and related
  server-side logic in `user.js` and `middleware/auth.js`) is important for building a user base and
  enabling future personalized features. This sprint can implement a basic signup/login flow with
  email/password authentication. Password recovery and profile management can be deferred to later
  sprints.

## Explanations for Prioritization

- **Focus on Core Functionality:** The top priorities are focused on getting the core recipe
  generation and rendering working first. This is essential to demonstrate the value proposition and
  allows for iterative improvements.
- **Addressing Critical Issues:** "Fix Recipe Schema, Model, and Rendering" is explicitly mentioned
  as a TODO, making it the highest priority to unblock further development.
- **MVP Approach:** For each feature, the focus is on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to
  validate the functionality and gather feedback before investing in more complex features.
- **Dependency Management:** Prioritization considers dependencies. For example, fixing the recipe
  schema is needed before effective rendering and database integration can be done for recipes.
- **Gradual User Feature Rollout:** User authentication is included but at a lower priority,
  recognizing that core functionality needs to be established before focusing heavily on user
  management features.

## Suggestions for New Features or Improvements

- **Advanced AI Model Selection:** Allow users to choose between different AI models (DeepSeek,
  Gemini, Claude, Grok, OpenAI) for recipe generation based on their preferences or desired recipe
  style.
- **Ingredient Input and Dietary Filters:** Enhance the recipe prompt to allow users to specify
  ingredients they want to use or avoid, and incorporate dietary filters (vegetarian, vegan,
  gluten-free, etc.) directly into the prompt.
- **Recipe Rating and Reviews:** Implement a system for users to rate and review generated recipes,
  providing valuable feedback and community engagement.
- **Shopping List Generation:** Automatically generate shopping lists from recipes for easier
  grocery shopping.
- **Language Selection UI:** Create a user interface element to easily select the desired language
  for recipe generation.
- **Integration with Calendar/Meal Planning Tools:** Allow users to schedule recipes into a meal
  plan and integrate with calendar applications.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features:** Enhance the platform to function as a PWA for offline
  access and app-like experience.
- **Monetization Strategy:** Explore potential monetization strategies (e.g., premium features, ads,
  partnerships) for long-term sustainability.

## Risks and Concerns

- **AI Model Performance and Cost:** The quality and reliability of the generated recipes depend
  heavily on the chosen AI models. The cost of using these AI APIs could also be a significant
  factor. **Risk:** Poor recipe quality, high operational costs.
- **Complexity of Multi-AI Engine Integration:** Managing and switching between multiple AI engines
  (`claude.js`, `deepseek.js`, etc.) can add significant complexity to the backend. **Risk:**
  Increased development time and maintenance overhead.
- **Scalability and Performance:** Generating AI recipes and serving a growing user base could put
  strain on server resources. **Risk:** Slow performance, application instability under load.
- **Data Security and Privacy:** Handling user data and recipe information requires robust security
  measures and adherence to privacy policies. **Risk:** Data breaches, privacy violations, legal
  issues.
- **Content Moderation (User Feedback & Potentially AI output):** User feedback and potentially even
  AI-generated content might need moderation to ensure quality and prevent inappropriate content.
  **Risk:** Negative user experience, reputational damage.
- **Dependencies on External APIs (AI, Search, Image):** Reliance on external APIs introduces
  dependencies and potential points of failure. **Risk:** Service disruptions, API changes requiring
  code updates.

## Recommendations for the Development Team

- **Focus on Iterative Development:** Embrace an agile approach with short sprints and frequent
  releases. Prioritize core functionality and iterate based on user feedback.
- **Start Simple with AI Integration:** Begin with one AI engine (e.g., OpenAI) for the initial MVP
  to simplify development and focus on core functionality. Gradually integrate other engines later
  if needed.
- **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
  throughout the application, especially for AI API interactions and database operations.
- **Prioritize Performance and Scalability:** Consider performance and scalability from the outset.
  Optimize backend code, database queries, and explore caching strategies. Dockerization is a good
  start, consider load testing early.
- **Security First Approach:** Implement security best practices at every stage of development. Pay
  close attention to authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Thorough Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to
  ensure code quality, identify bugs early, and maintain application stability.
- **Clear Documentation and Communication:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for the
  codebase, APIs, and architecture. Encourage open communication within the team and with
  stakeholders.
- **Utilize Project Structure:** Leverage the existing project structure and component-driven design
  to maintain code organization and accelerate development.

By focusing on these prioritized features and considering the risks and recommendations, the
development team can make significant progress in the first sprint towards building a functional and
valuable "My Healthy Food" platform.
