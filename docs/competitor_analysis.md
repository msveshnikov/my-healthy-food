- **Ingredient-Based Search:** Allows users to find recipes based on what they have available.

**Strengths Compared to My Healthy Food:**

- **Strong Niche Focus (Plant-Based):** Clearly defined target audience, potentially attracting
  users specifically interested in vegetarian/vegan cuisine.
- **Mobile-First App:** Dedicated mobile app might offer a smoother user experience for on-the-go
  recipe access.

  multi-language, and likely focused on major Western languages.
- **Less Emphasis on Healthy Eating Beyond Plant-Based:** While plant-based is often associated with
  healthy eating, "My Healthy Food" might target a broader definition of "healthy" (low-carb,
  specific dietary needs, etc.).
- **Potentially Less SEO & Sharing Focus:** While sharing might be present, SEO optimization for web
  discoverability is likely less of a priority for a mobile-first app compared to "My Healthy
  Food"'s web platform.

  emphasized as "My Healthy Food"'s planned integration with Unsplash/Google Images for visually
  appealing recipes.
